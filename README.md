# HipDynamics

### Summary

*HipDynamics* is a R based downstream live-imaging analysis for the [Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative (HIPSCI)][1]. The analysis allows quantification of cell population dynamics after preliminary image analysis of live images by [CellProfiler][2] and incorporation of `plate_result.txt` files generated from standardised end-point assays by the [Operetta][3].


#### Installation
*HipDynamics* comes with a preconfigured directory structure and settings. In order to install *HipDynamics* simply pull this git-repository and everything should be set up for you. 


#### Settings

*HipDynamics* holds all configurable variables within the `hipDynamics.R` file. 

1. The database login-in- and end-point details need to be specified. 
2. The `plate_result.txt` files directory path should be assigned to `path_PR`.
3. Optional settings allows specifying different analysis-methods and data exports.


#### Go-time

In order to run *HipDynamics* you need to enter the R-shell type the following command (provided you are within *HipDynamics*' directory folder and all settings were specified):

```R
source("hipDynamics.R")
```

#### Running the example

In order for you to run the example, you need to download the `example_data.sql` mysql database file from [Google Drive][4] and import it to your mysql sever. *HipDynamics* will try to find the database on your localhost by default. Shoul you want to run your server non-locally you can configure the `host` variable in the `hipDynamics.R` file.
