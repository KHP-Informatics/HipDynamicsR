#### Running the example

In order for you to run the example, you need to download the `example_data.sql` mysql database file from [Google Drive][1] and import it to your mysql sever. *HipDynamics* will try to find the database on your localhost by default. Shoul you want to run your server non-locally you can configure the `host` variable in the `hipDynamics.R` file.
